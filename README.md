##Usage  
Call .orize() on a jQuery object.  It takes a JSON object as a parameter.  Set the value of 'orizer' to the name of the orize kit to invoke.  

##Custom Kit  
To make a custom orize you must create a folder within the kit folder.  In that place a picture named picture.png and a sound clip named sound.mp3 (and .ogg for greater support).
